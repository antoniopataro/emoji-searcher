# Emoji Searcher 🔎

This is a simple Emoji Searcher app. 🤣

Did it initially as some sort of speedrun to test my skills, but later on I focused on improving its UI. 💨

### Info 🖋️

Logic was super easy. 😎

Design not that easy, but super fun to create. It even has shortcuts!

Got the emojis list object from [here](https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search/blob/master/src/emojiList.json) (and modified it a little bit).

### Libs 📚

- `styled-components`;
- `redux` - showed to be easier to manipulate themes and searches when on a higher level of modularization;
