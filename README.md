# Emoji Searcher 🔎

This is a simple Emoji Searcher app. 🤣

Did it initially as some sort of speedrun to test my skills, but later on I focused on improving its UI, implementing shortcuts and animations. 💨

### History 🖋️

Logic was super easy. 😎

Design not that easy, but super fun to create. It even has shortcuts!

Got the emojis list object from [here](https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search/blob/master/src/emojiList.json) (and modified it a little bit).

### Technologies ⚙️

I created this project using `Vite` as its plugin. Chose `React` as framework - I was afraid of `Typescript` util then.

Styled the project using `styled-components` and used `redux` to manage shared states between components, which was a bad choice due to overkill: there's no need for `redux`. I was just **scared** of `ContextAPI` at the time.
