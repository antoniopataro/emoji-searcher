# Emoji Searcher 🔎

This is a simple Emoji Searcher app. 🤣

Did it as some sort of speedrun to test my skills. 💨

## Info

Got the emojis list object from [here](https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search/blob/master/src/emojiList.json) (and modified it a little bit).

Logic was super easy. 😎

Got stuck with stylization related to grid and auto-fit, but was able to solve it (last commit). Apparently `grid-column` property was missing. 🖌️

## Libs

- `styled-components`;
- `AOS`;
