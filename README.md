Did it initially as some sort of speedrun to test my skills, but later on I focused on improving its UI. 💨

## Info 🖋️

Logic was super easy. 😎

Design not that easy, but super fun to create. It even has shortcuts!

Got the emojis list object from [here](https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search/blob/master/src/emojiList.json) (and modified it a little bit).

## Libs

- `styled-components`;
- `redux` - needed it for passing themes and other states, making everything cleaner (it was a mess with react's context);
