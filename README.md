# emoji searcher

i made this project to test my recently-learned skills. i decided to focus more on its ui, implementing shortcuts and animations.

looking back to it, i think it's crap.

i got the emojis list json [here.](https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search/blob/master/src/emojiList.json)

### stack and dependencies:

- react.js
